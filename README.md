## ðŸ’» Project

The project was developed in order to solidify the knowledge of java using the spring boot framework with a connection presistened in mysql. Using docker to create containers for the program to work in any environment.
I can say that the project includes an example of how to develop a safe and functional API.

## Technologies

This project was developed with the following technologies:
- [Java 11](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/)
- [Sprring](https://spring.io/)
- [MySql](https://www.mysql.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Architecture
The spring boot architecture flow

<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Fig-2-Architecture-flow-of-spring-boot-Applications-Spring-boot-uses-all-the-features_fig2_341151097"><img src="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sr-Swamy/publication/341151097/figure/fig2/AS:887752266616836@1588668042046/Fig-2-Architecture-flow-of-spring-boot-Applications-Spring-boot-uses-all-the-features.ppm" alt="Architecture flow of spring boot Applications Spring boot uses all the features of Spring like Spring MVC, Spring Data and JPA. A generic Spring Boot application consists of a controller which serves the clients HTTP request. This controller then interacts with the service layer which processes the request to modify the model and the database using the JPA repository through dependency injection. A view page is returned to the user if no error occurred. The architecture of a typical Spring boot application is presented in Fig 2."/></a>

### Database
The Database Model
![Model Entity Relationship](MER.PNG)
 The database structer file is `engailtonoliveira/spring-boot-mysql-docker/up_vote_db_bk.sql`

## Instalation
To execute the repository first downloat for your machine or do the  `Git Clone`

### Backend 
- open the folder `spring-boot-com-mysql/` on your IntelliJ
- go to the right panel and open `Maven Project`in Livecycle select `clean` and `install` than click in `Run Maven build`
- last open your terminal and type `docker-compose up --build --force-recreate` 
- run database script `up_vote_db_bk.sql` for create structer database (obs: it is a temporary solution later i will use the generated database)

#### Usage
One the docker is running, open the Postman collection `engailtonoliveira/spring-boot-mysql-docker\post-upvote.postman_collection.json` and you will be able to send/recive API request. 
Several example requests are provided in the collection. Below is a screenshot of a Postman example.
![Postman screenshot](postman.png)

I will be exemplify how to test
- For registe the user send `post-upvoute.AuthController.sigup`
- For sigin on aplication send `post-upvoute.AuthController.signin` (obs: it will be send the Authorization use than for send data to the restring URL)
- For Post the question you need to send the `post-upvoute.PostController.createPost` (Obs: remeber change the Authorization token for the user was signin)
- To Vote one of the choice u need to send `post-upvoute.PostController.castVote`

Obs: have other enpoinds configured, feel free to test

### Frontend
Unbelievably it will be as future work
